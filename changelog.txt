RebornRec 0.4.1 - the "AWESOME" update
Improved support for skins for builds before late 2018 (skins actually now work in those builds)
The server will now automatically re-detect the build version if it ever gets restarted while playing a build (in case it crashes or something similar)
Quest chests in 2018 will now give tennis skirts just like 2017 (for parity (and more skirts))
Added some community suggested words and some of my own aswell to charades (original ones still exist btw)
Added a missing api required for july 2017 builds to work (curse of the campus witch is now possible)
Updated the websocket so that the recnode build works (???)
Added a water bottle as the weekly in 2018 (they put something in the water)
Personal bubble should now be off by default in all builds instead of just 2018 (if this is problematic please tell me)
Optimized the server a bit (server should be slightly faster now :D)
Switching builds should be more stable (no more "not actually switching versions")
Fixed saturday's third daily objective being broken

Supports every build from 2016-2018, All builds currently available are in the #builds channel inside the Discord server.
